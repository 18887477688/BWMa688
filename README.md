- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @BWMa688
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Machine learning in Materials Science and data analysis, SISSO.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning symbolic regression in perovskite ceramics. Here will be my usual use of some code, welcome to discuss with me.

How to use
-------------
This project covers some common ML model training and feature engineering methods
Attention
-------------
Cross-validation should be added during the training process to demonstrate the generalization ability of the model, and the data results should be saved for subsequent analysis
About SISSO
-------------
SISSO is an ML algorithm created based on symbolic regression
SISSO is related toï¼šhttps://github.com/rouyang2017/SISSO

Introducation

A Fortran mpi compiler is required to compile the SISSO parallel program. Below are two options for compiling the program using an IntelMPI compiler (other compilers may work as well). In the folder 'src', do:    
(1)  mpiifort -fp-model precise var_global.f90 libsisso.f90 DI.f90 FC.f90 SISSO.f90 -o ~/bin/your_code_name  
(2)  mpiifort -O2 var_global.f90 libsisso.f90 DI.f90 FC.f90 SISSO.f90 -o ~/bin/your_code_name
